# Pokedex
With over 800 Pokémon in the Pokémon universe, it's hard to keep track of them all. A Pokédex gives trainers all the information needed to team and to become a Pokémon master. This interactive Pokédex allows users to search different Pokémon up by their name, type, or by their stats (not really haven't implemented). The Pokédex is written in Swift and implements Navigation controllers, SearchBars, and the MVC design pattern.
